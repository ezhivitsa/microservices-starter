This project is example of building application using principles of [microservices](https://microservices.io/) and [microfrontend](https://micro-frontends.org/) architecture. Also we used monorepository technique to combine all codebase inside one git repository.

## Structure

In [src](./src) directory contains 3 directories for 3 different purposes:
1. **[src/backend-services](./src/backend-services)** - directory consist of services which built upon microservices approach.
2. **[src/client-services](./src/client-services)** - directory with services to handle microfrontends architecture (built using [single-spa](https://single-spa.js.org/))
3. **[src/packages](./src/packages)** - directory with common use packages which can be used in backend services or client services or both

In every service and package we have more detailed description of its functionality and structure.

## Monorepository

For this project we have used monorepository approach. This has been implemented using yarn 2 [workspaces](https://yarnpkg.com/features/workspaces). Therefore now we are able to use our custom packages from the directory [src/packages](./src/packages) like ordinary npm packages.

## Commands

To write commands like installing npm dependencies we use `make` to write appropriate scripts. For example, to install npm dependencies for all workspaces to have to use command `make deps` in the root of the repository, or to build all packages from the directory [src/packages](./src/packages) you have to use command `make build`. Full list of available commands you can find in the [Makefile](./Makefile).

## Commits

We use projects `lint-staged` and `husky` to start tests on changed files. For example if you have changed files in authorization backend service we will start unit tests and lint tests for this service before commit.

## ToDo list:
1. add event sourcing to one backend service
