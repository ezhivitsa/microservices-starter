# UI demo client service

Demo pages for React components where you can see how do they look and also you can see code how to use them.

If you would like to see component in the demo list you have to add file `demo.tsx` to the needed component in the package `@packages/ui`.

In the top of the demo page we have a switch to change theme in order to see how component looks in different themes.
